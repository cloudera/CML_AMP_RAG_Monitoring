      Build a monitoring dashboard over a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. The dashboard should be able to monitor the model's performance and provide insights into the model's behavior. The AMP uses AWS Bedrock Models for indexing, response generation and evaluation and would need access keys for it to run.
