    long_description: |
      Build a monitoring dashboard over a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. The dashboard should be able to monitor the model's performance and provide insights into the model's behavior. The AMP uses either AWS Bedrock Models or Cloudera AI Inferencing for indexing, response generation, and evaluation. Access keys and/or endpoint details are required during environment setup for it to run.
